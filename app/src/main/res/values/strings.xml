    <string name="how">This is a Cube Puzzle. In which you have to solve the cube so that each face has blue color.
        \n
        As a precondition, you will get a puzzle board having 6 random blue squares.\n
        \nIf you roll the cube on to a blue square, the blue square is picked up on one face of the cube and
        if you roll a blue face of the cube on to a non-blue square, the blueness is put down again.
        \n\n

        Enjoy!!!!
